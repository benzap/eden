  - Added [[https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup][hiccup]] and [[https://github.com/davidsantiago/hickory][hickory]] libraries for html parsing and generation
    ie. ~html.stringify([:a "test"])~
    ie. ~html.parse("<a>test</a>")~

  - Added ~iterate~, ~add-watch~, ~remove-watch~

  - Added ~system.env(name)~ to get Environment Variables

    programmatically

  - Added ~system.set-global(name value)~ to set global variables

  - Improved Runtime Errors

  - Replaced clojure.string library with
    [[https://funcool.github.io/cuerdas/latest][a popular string library]]
* 0.6.0 (BETA SNAPSHOT)
  - Added css library under html.css, which is wrapped [[http://github.com/noprompt/hiccup][hiccup]] library
  - Added http client and server, which is [[http://http-kit.org]]
  - Added routing library, which is [[http://github.com/juxt/bidi][bidi]]
  - Example of http server in ./examples/bidi/http_server.eden
* 0.7.0 (BETA SNAPSHOT)
  - Added transit library under transit, which is a wrapped
    [[https://github.com/cognitect/transit-clj][transit-clj]] library
  - Added clojure.java.io under io
  - Changed how the parser associates getters and function calls to
    only target identifers (variables) and anonymous functions
    (function() ... end). This was done to mitigate issues with
    collection literals getting confused with functions calls and
    getters. This also likely means that metafunctions will never
    happen.
